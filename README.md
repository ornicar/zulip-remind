# Zulip Remind

Zulip bot that posts messages in a stream at a fixed date.

Also see: https://github.com/apkallum/zulip-reminder-bot.

I wanted a single service using redis, with support for fixed dates and public stream posting.

## Usage 

Use `@remind` to set a reminder for yourself, or for a stream.
Some examples include:

- `@remind me on June 1st to wish Linda happy birthday`
- `@remind me to stop procrastinating tomorrow`
- `@remind here in 3 hours to update the project status`
- `@remind stream to party hard on 2021-09-27 at 10pm`

Use `@remind list` to see the list of all your reminders.

Use `@remind delete` id to delete a reminder by its ID

## Setup

In Zulip, go to Settings -> Your bots, and add a new bot.

You may name it `remind` as I did, or anything else you like.

After it's created, download its `zuliprc` file and put it at the root of this project.

```
yarn install
yarn dev
```

And you're set, try using it from your Zulip instance.

## Production

Build a prod release:

```
yarn build
```

Deploy it to a server:

```
rsync -av zuliprc dist node_modules user@server:/home/zulip-remind/
```

Start it on the server:

```
node dist/index.js
```
